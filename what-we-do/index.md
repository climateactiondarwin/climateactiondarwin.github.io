We influence decision-makers to adopt climate-friendly policies.

We support Darwin residents to take climate action, and reduce their own climate impact.

We advocate for a transition to a zero carbon economy.

We inform and educate audiences on NT climate change impacts and solutionsâ€”including schools.

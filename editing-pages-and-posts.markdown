The content of Pages and Posts can be edited at any time, following the same *"Edit-Save-Publish"* workflow as when they were created.

#### Deleting a Page or Post

The **Delete Page** icon below the **Page Editor** allows a Page or Post to be removed. This can also be done from the main Pages or Posts section.

Note: if a Page or Post is accidentally deleted, all is not lost. The site can be rewound to a previous revision using GitHub. However, it's best if this is done swiftly and before other site administration occurs.

#### Changing metadata and layout

**Metadata** and **Layout** can also be changed after a Page or Post is published.

#### Including HTML in Pages

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) supports the inclusion of raw HTML inline in content blocks.

This means that custom markup can be added to any Page or Postâ€”this might for instance include your preferred video embed code. Do this with care as some HTML might break page layout.

<script type="text/javascript">
   console.log("Test!");
</script>

Established in 2009, Climate Action Darwin is a 600 strong grassroots
community group. We believe it is our moral obligation to current and future
generations to prevent and reverse climate change. 

We do this at a local level by supporting Darwin residents to take action, advocating for a transition to a zero carbon economy, and influencing decision-makers.

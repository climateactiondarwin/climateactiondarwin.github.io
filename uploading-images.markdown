Siteleaf provides a facility called **Uploads** which allows you to manage digital resources that are part of your site.

**Uploads** can be accessed either ad hoc when creating a Page or Post, or directly when you want to upload a whole set of files (for example, photographs).

Uploads are stored by filename in the site, so it's wise to change the name of a photograph or document you want to upload to something that will make sense to you and to other people administering the siteâ€”"July Climate Rally.jpg" not "DCIM_123446.jpg". However, you'll still have an image preview function to help you when choosing photographs.

#### Uploading a group of files

Select the **Uploads** button from the left hand of the Siteleaf interface.

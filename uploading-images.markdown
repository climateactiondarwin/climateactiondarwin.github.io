Siteleaf provides a facility called **Uploads** which allows you to manage digital resources that are part of your site.

**Uploads** can be accessed either ad hoc when creating a Page or Post, or directly when you want to upload a whole set of files (for example, photographs).

Uploads are stored by filename in the site, so it's wise to change the name of a photograph or document you want to upload to something that will make sense to you and to other people administering the siteâ€”"July Climate Rally.jpg" not "DCIM_123446.jpg". However, you'll still have an image preview function to help you when choosing photographs.

#### Uploading a group of files

Select the **Uploads** button from the left hand of the Siteleaf interface.

The Uploads interface appears, allowing you to search for previous uploads by name, or upload a group of files. Choose **Upload files** to select new files for the site.

Your files will be uploaded. Tools in the **Page Editor** can now be used to insert these files into your Pages and Posts.

#### Inserting an Image in a Page or Post

Go to the **Page Editor** as described in [Creating a Page](/creating-a-page/).

The **Insert file** tool is a small photo icon at the top of the editor.

Note that from this tool you can either upload an Image directly, or select from your **Existing Uploads**.

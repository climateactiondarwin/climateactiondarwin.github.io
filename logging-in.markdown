###### [Back to the site user manual](/administration/)

The Siteleaf content management system (CMS) is best accessed via a GitHub third party login because site data is stored in a GitHub repository. The steps below explain the process to log in.

First, visit [SiteLeaf](https://manage.siteleaf.com) and choose the "Log in" option.

#### Logging in with info@climateactiondarwin.org.au

The **info@climateactiondarwin.org.au** account has been created as an Admin user of the site. The password to use will be communicated elsewhereâ€”if in doubt, talk to the person who invited you to administer the site.

#### Logging in with GitHub

The site synchronises with GitHub using a GitHub account. You'll need the **climateactiondarwin** credentials for GitHub to log in this way, but if you have them will also be able to administer the site contents on GitHub.

Choose the "Log in with GitHub" option on the Siteleaf login screen to log in this way.

On the GitHub login screen, enter the Climate Action Darwin GitHub credentials.

#### Select the Climate Action Darwin site

After logging in successfully, you will be returned to Siteleaf. Select the "Climate Action Darwin" site from the list of sites. This takes you to the [main Siteleaf administration interface](/the-siteleaf-interface/).

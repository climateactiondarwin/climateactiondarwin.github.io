[Bleaching of coral reefs](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-14/coral-bleaching-sign-nt-marine-ecosystem-under-threat-scientists/9544956) along the northern coastline was reported at Cobourg Peninsula in 2018 and the Crocodile Islands in 2016 from rising sea temperatures.

[A severe and widespread mangrove die-off](http://theconversation.com/a-wet-warning-from-australias-top-end-on-rising-sea-levels-22934) occurred along 1,000 km of coast in the Gulf of Carpentaria in 2015. It was caused by unseasonal heat, lack of rain, and the third-strongest El Niño ever recorded.
 
Due also to increasing heat, it is predicted [there will be no male sea turtle hatchlings born at the Bare Sand Island hatchery](https://espace.cdu.edu.au/eserv/cdu:8990/Guinea_8990.pdf) near Darwin within eleven years.

Climate-related events such as heat and tropical cyclones are resulting in **flora and fauna population losses**. For example, heat-related mass mortality in flying foxes has been recorded for some time. In 2018, [heat waves in northern Queensland killed more than 23,000 flying foxes](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2007.1385), equating to almost one third of Australia’s spectacled flying fox population. Other pollinator species are also at risk to changing climatic conditions, which will have cascading impacts on terrestrial ecology.

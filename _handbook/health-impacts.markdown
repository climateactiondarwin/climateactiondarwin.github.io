**Heatwaves are the most lethal type of weather event in Australia.**
 
Longer, more frequent and extreme heatwaves will make it more uncomfortable for visitors and residents of the NT. [Heat stress puts young children and the elderly at particular risk of heatstroke or heart attack](https://www.dea.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DEA_Heatwaves__Health_Fact_Sheet_06.pdf). More extreme hot days and heat waves can further compromise people with cardiovascular disease and respiratory diseases such as asthma.
 
Mosquito-borne disease (e.g. Ross River virus, Dengue fever) and infectious disease epidemics are [projected to increase](https://www.academia.edu/23004081/Adapting_to_climate_change_for_water_resource_management_Issues_for_northern_Australia) as a result of higher temperatures and increased humidity.
 
Rising temperatures nationwide are leading to increased stress, anxiety and depression, and in the worst cases, even suicide.

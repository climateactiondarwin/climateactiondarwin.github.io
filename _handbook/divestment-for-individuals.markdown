Divestment is the action of removing money that has been invested somewhere. Divestment has taken on great significance as a global movement as more individuals and institutions take action to ensure their money is not being used to fund projects and industries that they don’t agree with. Trillions of dollars have been taken from the fossil fuel industry and invested in more sustainable endeavours.

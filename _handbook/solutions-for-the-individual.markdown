Changing the way we live, eat, travel and do business is both exciting and interesting. It requires all of us to get on board and there is no better time than right now!  All over the world, millions of people are coming together to bring forth a more engaged and sustainable way of living. Darwin is no exception. There are many forward-looking, positive groups, businesses and organisations in our city working together to change the way they operate and bring on the low carbon economy we need. Not only that, there is much that we can do as individuals to change our climate impact. Together we exert enormous power.  

Climate Action Darwin is happy to bring together this resource for the Darwin community, listing many of the exciting and emerging opportunities we have to make a difference. 
 
* **People Power! Make yourself heard.** Raise the issue of climate change with friends, colleagues and relatives. Let them know your concern. You are not alone: the majority of Australians support more action on climate change. 
* **Tell your local MLA and MP your concerns.** Ask them to support a legislated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target. A phone call can make a big difference.

More pics of the [#ThisIsClimate ](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/thisisclimate) solidarity sit-in today by young Darwin mothers. The occupation of [Michael Gunner](https://www.facebook.com/TerritoryChief/)'s office by the mums was supported by a passionate rally of pastoralists, firies, unionists, great-grandparents, Indigenous land managers, school students and other concerned Territory voters calling for genuine climate action from the NT government. What we've seen so far from the NTG does not go anywhere near addressing the challenge that the [#ClimateEmergency](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/climateemergency) poses to the Territory.

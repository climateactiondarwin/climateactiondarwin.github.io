This [Saturday 22 January](https://www.facebook.com/events/142957683418108/), come to show your support for climate action and to write a message to Chief Minister Michael Gunner. With thousands of others around the country, we will be telling our politicians that enough is enough. Demands to be presented are as follows: 

1. NTG to declare a Climate Emergency.
2. Ban Fracking. No new fossil fuel or nuclear projects. End subsidies to the gas industry.
3. First Nations justice. Funding for Indigenous-led land management. Jobs on country to repair ecosystems, reduce emissions and fire risk.
4. 100% renewable energy by 2030. Build a 100% publicly-owned renewable energy system by 2030. Just transition for communities and guaranteed jobs for affected fossil fuel workers. Fund good low-emissions jobs in transport, manufacturing, disaster relief, health, education, energy, and climate adaptation.
5. NTG to legislate a binding emissions reduction target. Net zero by 2050, first increment in 2022

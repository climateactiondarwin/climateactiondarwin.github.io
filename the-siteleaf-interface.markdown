On the Siteleaf site home page, you will see all the site resources with which you'll be interacting: Pages, Posts, and Uploads.

**Pages** are one-off web pages for a specific purpose, like the About, What We Do, and Resources pages.

**Posts** are dated web pages with a set template that can be "indexed" and present in the site's RSS feed, like blog posts.

**Uploads** are images, or other media, that you upload to Siteleaf and then insert in your Pages and Posts.

Once created, Pages and Posts can be edited, and Uploads can be removedâ€”do this last with care since if the uploaded item is referenced in a Page or Post you will break that link.

On the Siteleaf site home page, you will see all the site resources with which you'll be interacting: Pages, Posts, and Uploads.

**Pages** are one-off web pages for a specific purpose, like the About, What We Do, and Resources pages.

**Posts** are dated web pages with a set template that can be "indexed" and present in the site's RSS feed, like blog posts.

**Uploads** are images, or other media, that you upload to Siteleaf and then insert in your Pages and Posts.

Once created, Pages and Posts can be edited, and Uploads can be removed—do this last with care since if the uploaded item is referenced in a Page or Post you will break that link.

Pages and Posts go through an *Edit - Save - Publish* workflow in which first content is changed, then the changes are saved, and finally the changes are "synced" to GitHub where they become a versioned part of the Climate Action Darwin site.

Editing is a pretty low risk activity—because of GitHub's functionality, it will always be possible to wind back to an older version of the site if a mistake is made.

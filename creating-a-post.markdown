###### [Previous: creating a Page](/creating-a-page/)

A **Post** is a dated and indexable **Page** that will become part of the site's [News](/news/) feed, and be indexed in its [RSS feed](/feed.xml).

#### Setting the Post date

The process of creating a Post is functionally identical to that of creating a Page, except that the choice of **Date** is significant.

The **Date** will control the order in which your new Post appears in the News Page and in the RSS feed, so select it with care.

#### Adding Author metadata

Every Post has an author, which defaults to "Climate Action Darwin" and is displayed alongside the date above the Post title.

To specify a different author for a Post, add a metadata field with the field name "author" and specify the author's name as the value.

#### Publishing

After you've completed and saved your Post, don't forget to use the **Publish changes** button to synchronise it with the publicly available site. This will cause the [News](/news/) index and the Post page itself to appear. The **permalink** to the Post will be based on the Post date and title.

### The Post summary

On the [News](/news/) index page, an excerpt from your new Post will appear with a *More â€¦* prompt allowing the reader to click through to the full Post. Your Post will also appear in the RSS reader of any subscriber to the site's RSS feed.

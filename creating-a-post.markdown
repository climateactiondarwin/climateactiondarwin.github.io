###### [Previous: creating a Page](/creating-a-page/)

A **Post** is a dated and indexable **Page** that will become part of the site's [News](/news/) feed, and be indexed in its [RSS feed](/feed.xml).

#### Setting the Post date

The process of creating a Post is functionally identical to that of creating a Page, except that the choice of **Date** is significant.

The **Date** will control the order in which your new Post appears in the News Page and in the RSS feed, so select it with care.

#### Adding Author metadata

Every Post has an author, which defaults to "Climate Action Darwin" and is displayed alongside the date above the Post title.

To specify a different author for a Post, add a metadata field with the field name "author" and specify the author's name as the value.

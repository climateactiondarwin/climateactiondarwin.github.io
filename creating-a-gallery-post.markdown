The site includes a custom **Layout** which allows a content administrator to create a "photo gallery" post with lightbox functionality.

The "gallery" **Layout** scans a Post for *all* images it contains, and converts them into a two-column layout with clickable images.

#### Creating a Gallery

To create a gallery, [create a Post](/creating-a-post/) as normal, then upload several images and insert them into the Post.

Notes: 

* It's probably better to place all the gallery images at the end of your Post
* The placement of images in your Post doesn't matterâ€”all images in the Post content will always be added to the gallery and removed from anywhere else in the Post

The end result looks like this:

![gallery-example.png](/uploads/gallery-example.png)

The images in the gallery can be activated to enlarge them, and the user can then navigate back and forward in the gallery.
